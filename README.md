# ASP.NET Core Sample API

This repository contains a simple ASP.NET Core Web API project used to demonstrate my typical backend stack and code style.

## Tech stack

- C# / .NET 8
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core (for data access)
- SQL Server
- Azure (App Service, Azure SQL)
- Docker (optional)

## What this API does

- Exposes a simple `/api/health` endpoint for health checks
- Example `/api/todos` endpoint for basic CRUD operations
- Follows clean structure suitable for real-world projects
